                                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                                <p><b>Q1. -- Summarize the distinction(s) from the traditional Klines &  Clines definition of the cyborg vs. the one that Clark is proposing as the main thesis of his book?</b><br>
                                Klines &  Clines saw cyborgs as human bodies that are enhanced by technology. Attaching machines to a body would aid the person. Clark saw cyborgs as advanced technology that did not necassarily have to be attached to humans. <br><br>

                                <b>Q2. -- From The book, "Cyberneticists were especially interested in self-regulating systems." What are 2 or more example of these, make sure to include both biological systems and also non-biological systems.</b><br>
                                One example of a nonbiological self-regulating system is a refigarator. Fridges use sensors to regulate temperatures in order to make sure the food inside does not spoil. One biological example is an ecosphere. Ecospheres are enclosed containers that have small ecosystems inside of them. The living organisms within the sphere regulate the environment, so the ecosphere does not need to be manually cleaned or fed. <br><br>

                                <b>Q3 -- What other kind of definitions of a hybrid humans are there that are not based on definations above but popular in literature, media culture, etc.</b><br>
                                In the fantasy style video game, Genshin Impact, there are characters that are half human and half adepti. Adeptibeast are mythical creatures known to fight along side gods. These characters appear to be mostly human and exists among other humans. However, they have features such as horns or ears, and posess elemental powers.<br><br>

                                <h3>Chapter 2</h3>

                                <b>Q1. -- Summarize a definition as described in the book of what the significant attributes  are for 'opaque' technology vs.'transparent' technology.</b><br>
                                Opaque technology requires a certian skillset to be able to operate. Transparent technology is more acessable to the general public. <br><br>

                                <b>Q2. -- Give some examples of technology that might be better served if it were more transparent and and also give some example of a technology that should be more opaque.</b><br>
                                One technology that should be transparent is an oven. People ned ovens and stovetops to be able to feed themselves and these operations should be done without challenges. One example of an opaque technology is a cash register. Cash registers require memorization skills and applications of math. If everyone knew how to use a cash register, that would create a security threat. <br><br>

                                <b>Q3 -- Does the watch and dictionary example discussed in the book, seem valid to you? Why?</b><br>
                                Both examples seem valid for explaining transparent and opaque technologies. <br><br>

                                <h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
                                <p>The section “Negotiable Body” provides three different examples that show how our senses can trick our perception. The first experiment involves the subject extending their hand and another person must tap the subject’s nose. The subject starts to feel as if their nose is two feet long. The second experiment has the subject place one hand under a desktop. Another person taps the subject’s visible hand and the surface of the desktop. The hidden hand will feel the sensation of being tapped. The third experiment is similar to the previous one, except it involves using a fake hand. In all three of these examples, the mind deceives the subject’s consciousness. Our brains support highly negotiable body images of ourselves. The section “Neural Opportunism” explains how our brains process images differently than how they actually exist. Our brains tend to omit information that is not relevant to the task at hand. Because of this reason, many things tend to get overlooked. The reading suggests that our visual brains are opportunistic, meaning they are ready to make decisions based on the fragments of information they put together. The section “Word Brains” discusses how the brain processes topics such as linguistics. The reading provides an example of a group of chimpanzees and how they were able to cognitively associate a shape of a plastic token with a pair or pairs of objects. Their brains were able to connect lower-order concepts (sameness and difference) with physical objects. Our brains are capable of matching patterns, sensory responses, and spatial awareness. However, our brains do not excel at logical processes such as deciphering binary code the way a computer does. The section “Scaffolded Thinking” talks about how our brains use aids and props to strengthen the weaknesses mentioned in the previous section. One example pointed out in this section is an artist using sketches to map out a drawing due to the constraints of human thought. The final section, “building better brains”, explains how our brains improve as they engage in new experiences. </p>
                                <p><b>Q1.Related to the text descriptions of how our senses work with our brain, explain your experiences where your senses have momentarily misled you or someone you know.
                                Give examples of this.
                              </b><br>
                                Since going to school in a highly populated downtown area, I have found that it is not uncommon to get followed when I am walking alone. I can usually sense when there is someone following me in an alarming way. However, sometimes my senses mislead me into thinking I am being followed when there is really no one there. I would be caught up with a false sense of danger. Another example occurs after I go on a boat. For the following days when I am trying to fall asleep, I still can feel the swaying of the boats. <br><br>

                                <b>Q2. What do the 'The Early Adopters Dream Technology' example on page 80 and the mangrove analogy starting on page 81 say about the role of language and its relationship to thought and meaning? Do you agree with the Author's assertions? Whether you agree or not, please explain why.</b><br>
                                The author appears to view language as a type of innovative tool that carries information. Language is one of the things that connect a community together by being the base structure for thoughts and communication. It is interesting how the author describes language as the catalyst that moved humankind into its first phase of cyborg existence. It feels as if the author is glorifying language as something that is not of human nature.
                                <br><br>

                                <b>Q3. The Ideas of 'meta learning' (page 67) and constructive learning (page 83) are brought up in this chapter. What do these 2 ideas have in common in terms of the process of learning and using information and memory? Please elaborate on your thoughts on how you can 'learn' something from this.</b><br>
                                Meta-learning focuses on exploiting information. The term “meta” is often used in the gaming community when referring to techniques that will allow the user to exploit game mechanics. Constructive learning focuses on building structures that can be used to aid in learning. The brain is building an environment to strengthen the absorption of information. Both of these learning ideas go beyond what is the baseline knowledge. They are used to develop a more in-depth understanding of a subject. These ideas will help me learn how to store and use information in an effective way. <br><br>

                                <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
                                <p><b>Q1. What are the 2 main components of action discussed in the book that are required for Telepresence to exist and function properly?
                                </b><br>
                                Telepresence has to be interactive and requires a telerobotic model that is able to recognize commands and give feedback between the user and device.
                                <br><br>

                                <b>Q2. What form of Telepresence do you think you have experienced? If you have not. What was the closest to it, and what was missing for it to not be telepresence?
                                </b><br>
                                I have experience using and creating VR technology to mimic being in the presence of an environment. I also have a Dolby movie theater in my town that gives a physical effect in addition to the movie experience. The viewer can control the seats to their preference.
                                <br><br>

                                <b>Q3. Speculate on what other mechanics and sensory modalities that are based on Telepresence ideas, might be possible. What other ways can we be 'displaced'? Where our perception of where we are and what we are sensing can be 'hacked' or 'rigged'.
                                </b><br>
                                The medical industry is developing prosthetics that can recognize brain waves to trigger movement. These models emulate the feeling of an actual limb. In a way, they “hack” the body. <br><br>
